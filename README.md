### üîß MVP Features Breakdown

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Basic Pre-Deployment SRE Check**
**Objective:** Validate deployment configurations and identify common pitfalls.  
**Workflow:**  
- **Input:** User provides a deployment configuration (e.g., YAML/JSON snippet).  
- **AI Tasks:**  
  - **Configuration Analysis:** Detect missing resource limits, exposed public IPs, or undefined health checks.  
  - **Simple Security Check:** Highlight basic security misconfigurations (e.g., open ports).  
- **Output:**  
  - **Pre-Deployment Report:** A concise report shared via Slack/Teams with actionable fixes.  
  - **Optional:** Simulated issue creation in Notion or Google Sheets for tracking.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Basic Continuous Cost Monitoring & Optimization**
**Objective:** Identify underutilized resources and suggest cost-saving actions.  
**Workflow:**  
- **Input:** Simulated cloud cost data and resource utilization metrics.  
- **AI Tasks:**  
  - **Utilization Analysis:** Detect low-utilization resources.  
  - **Cost Suggestion:** Recommend actions like scaling down or turning off non-prod resources.  
  - **Estimated Savings:** Provide rough daily/monthly savings estimates.  
- **Output:**  
  - **Cost Optimization Alert:** Notifications via Slack/Teams with actionable insights.  
  - **Basic Cost Plan Update:** Add optimization suggestions to a Google Sheet.
